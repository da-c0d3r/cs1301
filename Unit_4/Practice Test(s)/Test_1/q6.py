#Write a function called abstract_names. abstract_names
#should have one parameter: a list of lists. Each list will
#be a list of strings, each with a first name and a last
#name, and each with the same first name.
#
#For example, this could be one list of lists your function
#might receive:
#
# [["David Joyner", "David Tennant", "David Beckham"],
#  ["Ananya Birla", "Ananya Agarwal", "Ananya Chatterjee", "Ananya Roy"],
#  ["Inés Sainz", "Inés Suarez", "Inés Melchor"]]
#
#abstract_names should return a dictionary. The keys to the
#dictionary should be the first names, and the values should
#be lists of the associated last names. The last names should
#be sorted alphabetically.
#
#For example, with the list above, the dictionary returned by
#abstract_names would be:
#
# {"David": ["Beckham", "Joyner", "Tennant"],
#  "Ananya": ["Agarwal", "Birla", "Chatterjee", "Roy"],
#  "Inés": ["Melchor", "Sainz", "Suarez"]}


#Write your function here!
def abstract_names(big_list):
    return_dict = {}

    for small_list in big_list:
        first_name = small_list[0].split()[0]  # Extract first name from the first entry
        last_names = sorted([name.split()[1] for name in small_list])  # Extract and sort last names
        return_dict[first_name] = last_names
    
    return return_dict

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print (although the order of the keys may vary):
#
#{"David": ["Beckham", "Joyner", "Tennant"], "Ananya": ["Agarwal", "Birla", "Chatterjee", "Roy"], "Inés": ["Melchor", "Sainz", "Suarez"]}
