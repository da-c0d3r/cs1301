# **CS1301**
## [Unit 1: Basics](/Unit_1/)
 - **_1.1_ - Computing**: the basic principles of working with computers.
 - **_1.2_ - Programming**: the general workflow of writing and running programs.
 - **_1.3_ - Debugging**: the process of finding and fixing errors in your programs.
## [Unit 2: Procedural Programming](/Unit_2/)
 - **_2.1_ - Procedural Programming**: The general idea of writing sequences of instructions for the computer to perform.
 - **_2.2_ - Variables**: Creating and modifying data in our programs.
 - **_2.3_ - Logical Operators**: Establishing the truth or falsehood of relationships among variables in our programs.
 - **_2.4_ - Mathematical Operators**: Using arithmetic operators (addition, multiplication, etc.) to modify the values of variables in our programs.
## [Unit 3: Control Structures](/Unit_3/)
 - **_3.1_ - Control Structures**: The general idea of lines of code that can control other lines of code.
 - **_3.2_ - Conditionals**: Lines of code (called if statements) that check logical expressions to see if certain code blocks should run.
 - **_3.3_ - Loops**: Lines of code that instruct the computer to repeat a block of code until some condition is met.
 - **_3.4_ - Functions**: Miniature programs within a larger program, each with their own input, code, and output.
 - **_3.5_ - Exception Handling**: Lines of code that instruct the computer how to fail gracefully when errors are encountered.
## [Unit 4: Data Structures](/Unit_4/)
 - **_4.1_ - Data Structures**: The general idea of data types more complex than individual letters and numbers.
 - **_4.2_ - Strings**: Ordered series of characters that often represent natural human language.
 - **_4.3_ - Lists**: Ordered series of other kinds of data, collected under one variable name and accessed via numeric indices.
 - **_4.4_ - File Input/Output**: Writing a program's data to a file so it can later be re-loaded after the program is closed and reopened.
 - **_4.5_ - Dictionaries**: Pairs of keys and values collected under one variable name, like lists with non-numeric indices.
## [Unit 5: Objects & Algorithms](/Unit_5/)
 - **_5.1_ - Objects**: Creating and using custom data types so our programs can reason about the world the way we do.
 - **_5.2_ - Algorithms**: Complex sequences of instructions that transform data or generate useful conclusions.
